# Gaussian Elimination Solver

A web-based interactive tool that builds and solves linear systems using **Gaussian Elimination** and presents each step visually.

This project helps students, engineers, and anyone studying linear algebra understand the full workflow of row operations, pivots, and reduced row-echelon form (RREF).
